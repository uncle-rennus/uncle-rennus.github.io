## ðŸŽ¯ What This Repository Does

This is a personal blog website built with **Hugo**, a static site generator, using the **PaperMod** theme. The site is deployed to **GitHub Pages** with a custom domain (`rennus.me`) and features automated CI/CD through GitHub Actions.

### Key Features:
- **Static Blog Site**: Personal blog with posts about technical topics
- **Hugo + PaperMod**: Modern, fast static site with a clean, readable theme
- **Custom Domain**: Hosted at `rennus.me` via GitHub Pages

- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with dark/light theme support

### Content Overview:
- **3 Blog Posts**: 
  - A first post/introduction
  - A setup/welcome post with gaming references

- Only 3 posts, with one being very minimal
- No about page or author information
- Missing content strategy or posting schedule

**Content Consistency**
- Mixed front matter formats (YAML vs TOML)

- Missing RSS feed configuration
- No sitemap customization
- Missing robots.txt

**Performance Optimizations**
- No image optimization pipeline
- Missing CDN configuration
- No caching headers configuration

### 3. **Development Workflow**

**Local Development Setup**

- Missing development scripts or Makefile
- No local environment configuration

**Content Creation Workflow**
- Basic archetype template could be enhanced with more metadata
- No content creation scripts or automation
- Missing draft review process

### 4. **Security & Maintenance**

**Dependency Management**

- No search functionality

**Content Discovery**
- Limited use of tags and categories
- No related posts functionality
- No content series or collections

### 6. **GitHub Actions Workflow**

**Security Improvements**
- Could use more restrictive permissions
- Missing security scanning steps
- No artifact retention policy

**Workflow Enhancements**
- No build caching to speed up deployments
- Missing link checking or HTML validation
- No deployment notifications

## ðŸš€ Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements (High Priority)
1. **Add README.md** with setup, development, and deployment instructions
2. **Create an About page** with author information and blog purpose
3. **Add proper SEO configuration** in `config.toml`
4. **Standardize front matter format** across all posts (prefer YAML)
5. **Add Google Analytics** if analytics are desired

### Medium-term Enhancements
1. **Expand content strategy** with regular posting schedule
2. **Add contact/social links** in the theme configuration
3. **Implement proper 404 page**
4. **Add automated dependency updates** for the theme
5. **Add build caching** to GitHub Actions workflow

### Long-term Goals
1. **Add search functionality** using lunr.js or similar
2. **Implement automated link checking** in CI/CD
3. **Add performance monitoring** and optimization
4. **Create content series** for related technical topics
5. **Add newsletter or RSS feed promotion**

## ðŸ“Š Overall Assessment
